# Board-Game-with-Discrete-Structures-Specs
This program allows two users to play a board game where each player is given 5 pieces on the board. Each piece can only move forward, and each piece can eat the other player's pieces. This program follows the Linux Kernel coding standard. Finally, this program was created with only propositional logic and set theory symbols written in the specs.
